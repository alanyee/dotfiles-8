### Todo

*   more BSPWM window manuevers
    * better keybinds (able to mash a direction and hit parent nodes in that direction if deadend with nodes)
*   get used to mutt/run in a tmux session.
*   run BFG repo cleaner on this repo
    *   figure out background storage first.
*   make a new workflow webm.
*   window decorations w/ lemonbar dickery
*   scratchpad handling?
*   better document and 'clean' things within the dotfiles themselves(never ends)
