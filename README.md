Further details can be found within the folders here themselves, at a top level. The README's assume you are familiar with the tool/program you are reading about, and describe how I use them in my setup.

`depends.txt` contains the programs used, and references quite a few AUR packages.

I use GNU stow to manage my dotfiles, here's a gross one-liner to list existing file conflicts if you were to link these files: `stow -n $(ls */ -d | grep -v root) 2>&1 | grep -oE ":.+" | cut -c3-`
